## Prompt & Context Engineering Quiz
---

### Question 1
Which of the following best exemplifies the failure mode inherent to **inadequate prompt engineering** rather than context engineering?  

**Options:**  
A) The model generating outdated policy information despite having access to recent documents  
B) The model producing responses in an unpredictable format due to ambiguous instructions  ✅
C) The model retrieving irrelevant passages from the knowledge base  
D) The model hallucinating information that contradicts the provided context

**Options:**  
A) Crafting instructions to guide AI outputs while iteratively refining them  ✅
B) Selecting random data passages for AI to generate outputs  
C) Writing code to modify AI’s neural network weights  
D) Designing hardware to improve AI processing speed

### Question 3
A system is configured with the following parameters: **Temperature 0.2, Top-P 0.95, Top-K 30**. According to the document's recommended starting points, this configuration is best suited for:  

**Options:**  
A) Highly experimental and unconventional creative outputs  
B) Mathematical computations requiring absolute precision and determinism  
C) Real-time language translation requiring maximum computational speed   
D) Balanced scenarios requiring moderate creativity with consistency safeguards ✅

### Question 4
In a **Policy Q&A bot** implementation, the document mentions that context engineering involves "metadata filters like `department=HR`" and "freshness boosts." The strategic purpose of these mechanisms is to:  

**Options:**  
A) Increase the total number of retrieved documents to maximize coverage  
B) Ensure only the most current and contextually relevant policy passages are prioritized  ✅
C) Reduce the computational cost by limiting the model's vocabulary  
D) Improve the aesthetic presentation of retrieved documents

### Question 5
What is the MAIN failure mode if **prompt engineering instructions are vague or ambiguous**?  

**Options:**  
A) AI produces hallucinated or outdated answers  
B) AI crashes due to memory overload  
C) AI increases token consumption unnecessarily  
D) AI returns messy or incorrect formats  ✅
